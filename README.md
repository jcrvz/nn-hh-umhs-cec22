This repository contains the results from A Primary Study on Hyper-Heuristics Powered by Artificial Neural Networks for Customising Population-based Metaheuristics in Continuous Optimisation Problems presented on CEC 2022. The following version of Customising optimisation metaheuristics via hyper-heuristic search (CUSTOMHyS) was used for the proposed NN-HH model experiments.
